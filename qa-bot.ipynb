If you are talking about a pure visualization tool Tableau is slightly better. Data connectors, modeling and transformation features are available in both. However, factually speaking Power BI is cheaper and offers tighter integration with the Microsoft environment. Since most companies use excel & Microsoft tools they start with Power BI or move towards Power BI for seamless integration with other Microsoft tools (called as Power platform).
